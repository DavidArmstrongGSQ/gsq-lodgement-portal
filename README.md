# GSQ Lodgement Portal

## Purpose of this document
Provide a specification for the new GSQ Lodgement Portal that:  
* Accurately defines the business requirements
* Is a key input to software design for a software developer  

The primary input into this document is the data model defined in the [Resources Industry Report Profile](https://github.com/geological-survey-of-queensland/industry-report-profile).

## Background
Resource authority holders need to submit a range of statutory reports on their activities. Reports include all mineral exploration, geothermal exploration, greenhouse gas exploration, petroleum exploration, petroleum well, seismic survey or airborne geophysical survey, mineral development licence, petroleum lease, and petroleum pipeline licence reports and some other exploration related reporting.

When government issues a permit to a holder, the legislation requires a permit holder to submit reports to the Department when certain activities are performed under the conditions of the permit.  
* The reports contain knowledge of the geological resource.  
* Historically, industry reports have been lodged through QDEX Reports.  
* GDMP will deliver a new lodgement portal to replace QDEX Reports.  
* Most industry reports have a confidentiality period before becoming open file.  

## The Lodgement Portal

### Objectives of the Lodgement Portal
1. Provide a single portal for industry and GSQ to lodge georesources reports.
2. Provide data validation at point of data entry.
3. Provide a database store to store in-progress and submitted reports.
4. Harvest the submitted metadata, data and datasets for insertion into CKAN, S3 and the [GeoProperties Database](https://github.com/geological-survey-of-queensland/ssor-database).
5. Provide search functionality for GSQ staff to search for reports.

### Vendor deliverables
1.	An online lodgement portal to allow industry users to submit reports and upload associated geoscience data files in a structured, itemised format.  
    a.	Data must be able to be submitted through a human-computer interface  
    b.	Data must be able to be submitted through a computer-computer interface  
2.	Automated workflows to process the geoscience data submitted to the data lake storage platform, including industry reports, industry data and internal data.
3.	A method of enabling the upload of large geoscience data files to the data lake storage platform.

## Four versions of the Lodgement Portal
There are 4 versions of lodgement portal to be built:
1. MVP Lodgement Portal to replace the current lodgement functionality of QDEX reports - described on this page.
2. Version 2 Lodgement Portal that parses the data lodged in the petroleum, coal, and mineral reporting guideline templates - described on [Version2-portal-README.MD](/Version2-portal-README.MD)
3. Version 3 Lodgement Portal that does some cool stuff - described on [Version3-portal-README.MD](/Version3-portal-README.MD)
4. Version 4 Lodgement Portal that does some additional cool stuff - described on [Version4-portal-README.MD](/Version4-portal-README.MD)
