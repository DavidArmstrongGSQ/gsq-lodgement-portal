# GSQ Lodgement Portal

## Purpose of this document
Provide a specification for the new GSQ Lodgement Portal that:  
* Accurately defines the business requirements
* Is a key input to software design for a software developer  

The primary input into this document is the data model defined in the [Resources Industry Report Profile](https://github.com/geological-survey-of-queensland/industry-report-profile).

## Background
Resource authority holders need to submit a range of statutory reports on their activities. Reports include all mineral exploration, geothermal exploration, greenhouse gas exploration, petroleum exploration, petroleum well, seismic survey or airborne geophysical survey, mineral development licence, petroleum lease, and petroleum pipeline licence reports and some other exploration related reporting.

When government issues a permit to a holder, the legislation requires a permit holder to submit reports to the Department when certain activities are performed under the conditions of the permit.  
* The reports contain knowledge of the geological resource.  
* Historically, industry reports have been lodged through QDEX Reports.  
* GDMP will deliver a new lodgement portal to replace QDEX Reports.  
* Most industry reports have a confidentiality period before becoming open file.
